let num: number = 12;
console.log(num);


num = 14;
// num = "a" //we'll get an error. because I'm trying to assign string in number typed variable

let str: any = "Abdul Moiz";
str = 12;
console.log(str);

// In "any" type you can assign whatever u want. but It's not recommended way

const bool: boolean = true;
console.log(bool);

const names: string[] = ["12", "42"];
